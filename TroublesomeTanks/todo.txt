DONE? fix tanks getting stuck in walls
DONE? slower going backwards twice as slow
DONE? turret rotation - there is a DGS flag for turrent independence
DONE? Cell recharging
	- directly choose cell with button
	- frees up X for battery charge? actually did it so that X cancels current charge
DONE? Battery Recharge
	- press X? no
	- constant but low recharge? Recharges when not connected to other things at half rate

DONE? player selection scene
	- need to add countdown textures
	- need to add press A textures/text

arena map files

improve start scene
	- new background texture with nice graphics and titles

better tank contrast to make turret angle more visible
	- could try the composite see through shader
	- could make the tank grey/white with the coloured accents

settings scene
game modes
	- finite battery versus infinite battery
	- most kills in set time versus to the death
	- area shrinkage over time

ion pulse
	- scrambles controls
	- drains power

EMP
	- Limited Use
	- needs fully charged battery

Bouncing bullets

Laser sight?

double damage back?


destructable environment?
	- or maybe dynamic gates?

different tank types?



record new audio sound effect assets
	- multiple pans clanking
	- gun fire
	- bullet collide with wall
	- character voices for events
		# hit other player
		# run out of energy
		# one more hit until death!
